Parsing natural language queries into SQL queries can be thought of as a specialized form of machine
translation. Over recent years, there has been a significant surge in scholarly interest in machine translation,
a central problem in the field of machine learning. Traditional machine translation primarily deals with the
conversion of text from one language to another, aiming to bridge linguistic gaps. In today's digital age,
businesses and organizations store vast amounts of data and records in relational databases. While these
databases offer robust data storage capabilities, retrieving the information they hold often necessitates
expertise in query languages like SQL, which are used to access and manipulate the data.
Generating SQL queries from natural language questions is a topic that has gained considerable attention in
both academic research and commercial applications. The process involves translating user questions
expressed in plain, everyday language into SQL queries that can efficiently retrieve data from relational
databases. This task is challenging due to the need to bridge the gap between the way humans communicate
and the structured, syntax-driven nature of SQL queries.
